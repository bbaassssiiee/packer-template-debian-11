# Packer Debian 12 (Bookworm) Template for Proxmox

Packer configuration for creating Debian 12 virtual machine templates for Proxmox VE. Inspired by, and based upon the work started by, [Roman Tomjak](https://github.com/romantomjak/packer-proxmox-template)

## Requirements

- [Packer](https://www.packer.io/downloads) 1.8.0+
- [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve) 7.3+

## Minimum background information

Launching a virtual machine requires an operating system to be installed. VM installation is usually done using an ISO image file and depending on the OS, this can be a time consuming task one might want to avoid. Luckily, this can be automated using a process known as _preseeding_.

> Preseeding provides a way to answer questions asked during the installation process, without having to manually enter the answers while the installation is running. You can check out the configuration for a standard Debian 10 installation in [preseed.cfg](http/preseed.cfg) and read more about this method in the [preseed documentation](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed).

Proxmox Templates provide an easy way to deploy many VMs of the same type, but naturally we don't want them to be _completely_ identical. They may need a different hostname, an IP address, etc. This is what _cloud-init_ takes care of.

> Cloud-init is used for initial machine configuration like creating users or preseeding `authorized_keys` file for SSH authentication. You can check out the configuration in [cloud.cfg](http/cloud.cfg) and read more about this in [cloud-init documentation](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Creating a new VM Template

Templates are created by converting an existing VM to a template. As soon as the VM is converted, it cannot be started anymore. If you want to modify an existing template, you need to create a new template.

Here's how:

Variables from the `debian-12-bookworm.source.pkr.hcl` can be overridden like so:

```sh
$ packer init
$ packer build -var "proxmox_host=10.100.150.10:8006" "proxmox_api_user=<<NOTAREALUSER>>" "proxmox_api_password=<<NOTAREALPASSWORD>>" .
```

or you can just as easily specify a file that contains the variables and multiple files as well:

```sh
$ packer init
$ packer build -var-file vars/debian_12.pkrvars.hcl -var-file vars.pkrvars.hcl.sample .
```

Be sure to adjust this code as necessary for your setup and to make sure *_NOT_* to commit the `.pkrvars.hcl` file that contains your credentials to your git repository.

## Deploy a VM from a Template

Right-click the template in Proxmox VE, and select "Clone".

- **full clone** is a complete copy and is fully independent from the original VM or VM Template, but it requires the same disk space as the original
- **linked clone** requires less disk space but cannot run without access to the base VM Template. Not supported with LVM & ISCSI storage types
